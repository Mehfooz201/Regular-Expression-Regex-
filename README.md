# Regular Expression (Regex)

Regular Expressions, also known as "RegEx" or "RegExp", are a powerful tool used for pattern matching in text. They provide a concise and flexible way to search, replace, and manipulate text.

RegEx can be used to verify if a string contains a specified pattern, extract specific information from a longer string, or replace parts of a string with a different value. They are widely used in various applications, including text editors, text processing utilities, search engines, programming languages, and more.

Some common use cases for RegEx include:

=> Validation: RegEx can be used to validate user inputs such as email addresses, phone numbers, etc.

=> Search and Replace: RegEx can be used to search for specific patterns within a string and replace them with a different value.

=> Data Extraction: RegEx can be used to extract information from large text files, such as log files, to extract important data.

=> String Manipulation: RegEx can be used to manipulate strings, such as splitting them into substrings or removing specific characters.
